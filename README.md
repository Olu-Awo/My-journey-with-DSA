I learnt a lot in excel, SQL and now to building my Portfolio.

## Project Topic:

### Data cleaning and preparation

In the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparation, I performed the following action:

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involves the exploring of data to answer some questions about the data such as;
- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which products are top sellers?
- What are the products on peak sales?
- Which products sells more at a particular time?

### Data Analysis
This is where I include some basic line of codes and some of the DAX expressions used during the analysis

SELECT A,B,C
WHERE A> 15
